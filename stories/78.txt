I know I'm not the greatest spy in the world, but I've gotten so much better. I've trained like a dog for fifteen hours a day and done everything I can to avoid being detected. I've developed techniques like making my fingers invisible, creating a secret compartment with my computer and phone, or hiding in a closet just out of the way. I can also make my hair look like a squirrel's to protect my identity.

You know the old saying: "Nothing kills a man like a good spy story"? I have a secret story, tooâ€”one I just don't want you to know.
