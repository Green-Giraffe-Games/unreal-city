I don't mean to condemn Mr. Fisher-King for his misdeeds but he was not a good king. The fishers had to leave the island to build boats and to move about. All the men were thrown together into one family which gave rise to a sort of caste system. People were often punished for failing to support the fishers or the king. They were branded red and then thrown into prison. We had to tie them up, tie them to trees and plant a lot of corn and sheep and then burn that so there wouldn't be much for them to eat.
