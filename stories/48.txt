There was something about my older brother that scared me a little bit. He was always so calm. He wasn't one to act on emotion, and he would never make an outburst. 

I still haven't spoken about the incident in which he was found with a shotgun in his car in front of elementary school. It wasn't long before he lost his job. He got divorced, I guess it was one of the worse things to happen to him in his life. This year he started a new job at an animal hospital, which is a pretty good move for someone coming from a bad background. I guess I can see why so many people feel sorry for him.
