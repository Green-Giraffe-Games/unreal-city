I wanted the name to sound more exotic and different even though this place is actually very fairly classic and not especially hip anymore.

I also wanted the name to be more generic so that if I'm wearing my T-Shirt or jeans there's at least a hint of the 'hip' and 'trendy' vibe going on.

Anyway, this thing is called icedtea, which means 'ice tea'‒ or simply 'tea that melts'.

I decided to go with that rather than the common 'ice teacups'.
