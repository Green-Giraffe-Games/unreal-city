There is something very beautiful and special about standing up for yourself when there is all this hate and killing and murder. I will walk from the grave holding a newspaper and a gun in my left hand and a Bible saying, "I may be a coward but I don't care if there is nobody around to help me." I can stand up for myself wherever and whenever I am.
