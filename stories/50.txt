At the age of fifteen, my parents brought me to the world of the mirrors. It was the most beautiful experience. Even when I grew up, I could not take my eyes off the mirror people. I was fascinated by the mirror people. The mirrors were like a playground for me. There was nothing else like it. I was born a mirror creature and I am still a mirror person.

As I am one of the mirror creatures, I will join the battle in the very middle of the mirror world. I should like to think that the fishes will help humanity by forming the basis of a universal community. But the fishes are not so nice.
