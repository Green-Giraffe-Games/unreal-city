There are no shadows, because shadows are to my eyes the only true forms. I know every trace of my existence. This is an art. It reveals everything, and everything I love. In this fashion, I am a shadow's shadow.

There are no things behind the shadows and none in-between, and therefore neither shadows nor people nor images are anything to me. They do nothing for me except to create shadows; to reveal things, to conceal things, and to leave footprints. The greatest artist was never a person or a painting; he was a mask, a shadow's shadow, a mask in shadow.
