My wife and I were watching TV in mid-afternoon, on cable, when something hit our TV screen, hard. Not the usual soft hit hits, like the jiggers of a hammer or the clank of a chain—the hard hits, like the sharp pain a broken blade sends through the brain, like the pain of loss, like what the human mind can do when it's in a state of shock, like the weight inside your head, burning away slowly and slowly, like the heat of a sun on a chilly winter day.

My wife put that TV down after 30 seconds—that hit wasn't the kind we usually watch out loud without headphones. The television's been plugged in all day, my wife says, her voice husky—it's been in standby mode. As she continues to stare at her screen, her eyes seem to go wider and wider, and she's able to see an opening on the screen. As she gets closer, she can make out the silhouette of a man, about the same height as my wife, sitting motionlessly on the couch, his eyes glazing over.
