I came back from a trip to Japan and started to make clothes out of scrap metal, plastic and other materials that were brought back by people who had come back from the War. It was very much about trying to understand if I would have an alternative life once I was out of Japan but also to find a way to make ends meet and make myself understand that it is OK not to have a career.
