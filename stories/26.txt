The place was warm. Everything was bright and colorful. The trees were tall. The mountains that surrounded the village were vast. The sea was quiet and warm. It was all the things I wanted and needed that night.

The stars looked big, but they also seemed to be getting harder and harder to see. They had made so many changes and became so distant that a simple sight could cause me to become disorientated. 

I did not understand the language of the world. It was so strange.
