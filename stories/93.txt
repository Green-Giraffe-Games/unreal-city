My father's house was like his own world, a vast oasis surrounded by mountains and deserts and sea and trees. There was a great library in one of the towers, a library that had stood for some hundred years, when, instead of being broken down and forgotten, it had evolved into something of real significance, and was now preserved in the style of a great public library. This library, I think, was the main attraction of the life of my father. He was a man of learning, a man who would give anything to learn. He would never be satisfied until he had learned all he wanted to know. He had read all the languages, and all the histories, in every language. He lived a life for himself, without being bound by anybody or anything. 

My mother had one of those brilliant and beautiful eyes, which were so vivid that when her pupils were filled, the whole room was as though it was glowing with its own light. When there was nothing to fill them, her pupils became so deep that we could sometimes see them clearly through curtains.
