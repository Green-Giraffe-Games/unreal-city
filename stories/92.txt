The children I created all ended up pretty much the same way (although their personalities may have evolved over time to fit under a 'cool' umbrella) - a cute 7 year old, a sweet teen, a quiet 21 year old, a nice 20 year old, someone with a mental illness... etc. I created them like I had created my father and I had created my mother, and I kept having children. I never had a problem with it and it all really worked out for the best.
