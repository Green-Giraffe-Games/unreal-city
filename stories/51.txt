At a party, I happened upon my friend's mother's photo of a strange looking creature standing still on her bed. It was surrounded by a green circle. It looked like a circle with eyes, eyebrows, and ears. Later on in life, I found out that it was the leader of a religious cult that was trying to control all forms of life. I know this because my friend's mother was so afraid of its presence, that she could not go into her room for several months at a time. When she finally did go into her room, she could not escape its presence, and kept being afraid of it, until she finally left and went to a different city.
