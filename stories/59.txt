I had to show up for this interview wearing a $1,200 T-Shirt with my name, address, and phone number on it. And now I have to wear this $1,200 T-Shirt with my name and address and phone number over and over. 

I didn't learn much from my experience about wearing a $1,200 T-Shirt. I did learn a few things: 1) I am the first person to wear one of these shirts with no pants under my clothes. It's awesome. 2) It will make me a big deal at a job interview. 3) It's just so cool to get so many compliments on it (when I wear it). 4) My name is on the back. As soon as I get fired, I'm going to take my name off the back and write my email address on the front and make myself available.
