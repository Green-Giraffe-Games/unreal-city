Our father was the kind of guy who would give us a violin and a piano when we were in the middle of a terrible storm. We always loved music.

Our mother is also brilliant. She's brilliant at music—probably better than most of the people in the house. She had the biggest bag of flute keys in the house, and you can just find all kinds of things you probably couldn't find anywhere else. 

But what we loved the most was what she did when we got home: singing. One of her greatest memories is a Sunday before Christmas when she's just sitting singing over the telephone with her husband. They're both watching The Simpsons, and suddenly she walks around the outside of the house, singing. We were pretty surprised, and a little overwhelmed. But her voice was magnificent, too. It wasn't just singing—it was like she were having some extraordinary conversation.
