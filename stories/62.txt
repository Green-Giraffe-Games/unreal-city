I do not tell my astronaut husband he is a hero. He is in my universe, but for me as a non-Astronaut I am supposed to take the role of the hero. I know that that he is just a regular Astronaut.

I see other things when I am not in the Space Station. I'm sitting in an open-air restaurant eating a grilled chicken meal, eating my vegetables without having to look up at the table. I wonder who the fuck is enjoying my salad. This is a place where I eat my vegetables and eat my vegetables well. I am grateful, I tell myself.
