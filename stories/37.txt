I felt sad when Venus smiled. I had always thought of her with contempt.

What kind of life was hers, if all she did were to sleep in her tent, or at night lie in the shadow of one of the shrubs that grew in the valley, or sing in the woods?

She was no match for her sisters' wild dreams. She never took part in any play or the games of the fairies, nor the games of the animals, nor the play with their fawns. She never slept in her house, and rarely stayed up till dark.
