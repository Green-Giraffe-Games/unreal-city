I love my husband. He has so much talent at what he does. He makes sure everybody at his job has awesome costumes and a super impressive wardrobe. He can use his occult abilities to break boundaries. When you think about it, it almost reminds me of a man that lived in a secret country that was called the World of Darkness. He is a very "manly" person.
