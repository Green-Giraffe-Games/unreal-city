I go through the trees during the summer, and the grass is still green and alive, and the blossoms are in bloom under my feet. I love nature, and I am happy. I go through the woods during the winter. The ground is covered with snow. I love the sound of wind, and my skin glistens with sweat as the wind rustles the underbrush.

I go through the water during the rain, and the cold water flows around me like a flowing river, soaking my flesh. I love the rain, the cold, the rain falling as it sweeps the sun's face, and I fall asleep.
