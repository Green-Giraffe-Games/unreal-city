A decade and a half ago, I was on a trip across the Atlantic Ocean with two other women, all high-class models, the youngest the age of 18. We had been at an estate in a seaside area, working for a photographer and a fashion store. The sun was beating down, the waves were breaking in my face. I felt so bad for my two beautiful young models, who spent their nights at the same room and ate from the same pot together. The first day, they were hungry, but didn't have enough of whatever it was they had. Two hours later, when I came back, they were gone. Their clothes, shoes and other belongings had been gone - everything they owned and had ever owned.
