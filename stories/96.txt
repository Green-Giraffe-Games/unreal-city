If I could live again - I will go to more places I haven't seen before... and make up some weird stories.

If I could live again - I will listen to music till it breaks my heart.

If I could live again - I will sing my own poetry for others.

If I could live again - I will love every moment I am on stage. 

If I could live again - I will love every second of my life.
