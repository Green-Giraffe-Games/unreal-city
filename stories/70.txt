I looked up at a massive, abandoned pyramid rising above the city. In front of it were giant machines â€“ white, with eyes that appeared to be the exact colour of a man's hair. I looked away from the pyramid and into the cityscape all around. There was another pyramid, larger than the first and the whole thing was surrounded by an endless maze of buildings.

'I wish these buildings weren't like this, I'm afraid,' I said as I wandered around. They were just like the places I'd visited before, but with no living things around to disturb me. The cityscape was completely deserted except for a few people wearing strange robes. Their faces were hidden by metal helmets.

'We're the only ones left,' someone mumbled.
'My, our city has lost all its wonders,' a man said.
