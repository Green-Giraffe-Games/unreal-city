We had no time for history or geography. We were, we told ourselves, so simple. We had nothing to worry about. Our father had taught us that when we get stressed, we need to shut down our emotions. We weren't really scared when he said that. We also told ourselves that if the sun shines in the morning, it's good - that was our mantra - that everything was going to stay the same.
