I've taught high school English for more than 30 years and, although at times I've felt a bit like I'm standing in one long, sprawling edifice with thousands of students cramming in a narrow classroom, I'm always looking for ways that I can improve. 

If I get the opportunity to teach English, it doesn't necessarily mean that I will try to teach the kids to talk. There may not be any instruction for speech that I can give at all to each student. It could be just the occasional hand gesture.
