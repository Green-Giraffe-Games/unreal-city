At some point in time, a friend of mine asked me what made me want to become a fortune teller. I told him about this woman who became rich by telling the truth. Now, my friend knew I was a fortune teller, but his face got really weird as well. He started yelling at me for saying this!  I replied "It's called fortune telling! It's a real thing!  It's the one thing you have to be able to do to do business."

What a weird guy!  He kept wanting to tell me more, trying all kinds of crazy lies to make me stop. Eventually, I decided to just put my feet up and let his crazy thoughts pass because I knew he knew little about business. And guess what? He lost all his money!
