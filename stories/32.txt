I had always admired maps. They showed the natural lines of movement of rivers and lakes and oceans across a vast plain; they seemed to make my world, that vast and uncertain domain, infinitely larger than any I could fathom. There, on one side of the map was a beautiful ocean lying below meâ€”which, if it was not covered with a veil of cloud, was perfectly clear, just as it was near the edge of this vast expanse of open heaven.
