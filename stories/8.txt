I always knew I wanted to build a better urn. I wanted it to be bigger, to be able to store more items, and I wanted it to have better textures. I wanted it to have an interesting looking shape. I wanted an urn that looked unique, something that would make a permanent mark in the hearts of those who enter it. 

When we started, my wife and I never imagined we would reach the level of success we have. We have achieved our dream.
