In China there are many secrets: the secret of being a farmer; of not thinking one's husband a duke; of eating the earth only sparingly; 

of waiting with pleasure for every moment when the sun would not shine; 

of feeling oneself to be a prince on the throne, the prince of Asia; of having no fear; 

of the joys of being a mother, when she is young, by a man; of the fearlessness of those who fear for the sake of their children, who cry for their father's help, when a child is in a difficult position; 

of not being embarrassed about the fact that the old man may, or may not, be a dead man; of not being afraid to die.
