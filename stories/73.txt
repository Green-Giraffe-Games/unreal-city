I was in a coma and I'd probably only lost four inches of length, but something just kept telling me that I was going to die. Doctors said things like, "You might want to consider having your skull wired against the head of a pin with five pins all connected to one thing, or against a metal pipe that runs in the wall and ends in a little pot." I had the audacity to go blind, and the doctors laughed at me. So now I'm blind, and I'm just going to have to deal with the consequences.
