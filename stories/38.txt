I found myself running in my mother's garden and the stinky stench of what had once been her garden. There were the big blue apple trees, the tiny tree that did none of the work of growing food, the one that didn't grow anything except berries. I tried my best to take some of the air out of the garden, so at least it would smell better, but after a while I was no longer able to breathe, and I realized that I would never wake up again.
