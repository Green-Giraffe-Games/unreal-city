 I came to France in the mid 1970s. I started in 1976 and today there are more than 200 airlines operating on France's airspace. I worked my way up to being president of France's air fleet in 1990. To this day I am able to travel across the country for work. I am a member of the Air France union, part of Paris Air Traffic Control, the Lufthansa group and the CAA air rights body.
