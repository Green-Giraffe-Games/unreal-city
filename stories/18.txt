We were happy when we read at night: we'd fall asleep reading, or while watching TV or doing simple household tasks, and sleep until morning was nearly past. But by day's end, what you'd read was always the same: the same book, with only minor changes, and a completely different story. 

The difference in our lives was like a giant mirror. As a matter of fact, it was almost a myth. We were all just the same: the same person, born the same year, as the person who read in the bed at night. The differences were like little bumps, marks in the surface of our human soul: one at the back of the head, and one in the forehead, both visible to the eye.
