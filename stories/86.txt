When I was a child my dad worked for a company in the field of science and technology. He was a pioneer in developing advanced devices for the military and was a leader as a developer. A few years later, though, he passed away at age 50. We mournfully take time each year to reflect on all the things he gave us as we live with the consequences of his life, his legacy, and his work.

The secrets of what he gave us were never divulged to me until a few years ago. After a search of my parents' and father's letters, I found myself in the middle of a personal investigation of a mysterious book that contained many of my father's secret stories, along with some of his own secrets too. These stories were all so painful to write about, because they were as personal to me as to my father and me.

Over the past twenty years, they have seeped deeply into my heart, into my mind, in my dreams and in my thoughts. We all know that in each one of us, there is a secret that we have kept hidden away until someone else finds it. 

As my father's last moments approached, I thought how much the secrets he left behind have affected us all.
