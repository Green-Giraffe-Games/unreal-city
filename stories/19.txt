I will tell you of a place, far away, where I have been with a girl named Katerine, who liked to eat and drink and make merry - I was so fond of the girl.

She is now dead, but we hear that it is not forgotten that we were lovers, and that she enjoyed herself. 

I cannot say to her what I must tell her. I have not yet lost her - I am content.
