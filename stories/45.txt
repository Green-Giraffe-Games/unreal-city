I was walking late at night when a handsome red-haired youth strode by me in his silver jacket, silk shirt, leather breeches. His mouth and face were illuminated by the flame of the fire that had been lit by the fiery lamp. He said 'Hello! I hear there is a good day coming to-morrow!'

I shouted to him: 'Good day!' But he did not hear me; he turned with his face to the horizon with a golden smile, an infinite smile. His heart grew light and his eyes were full of tears.
