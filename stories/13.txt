My sister sent me some of her favourite books, and one of them is called "Dance of the Bees," which is written almost entirely in German. I read it on the sofa; I was very much interested, both because of the beauty and the melancholy, and also because it so perfectly captured the atmosphere of the place of dancing, and my sister's words, and, especially, these lovely words written by Mollie, who, in the whole of the book, is as beautiful as a man and as lovely as a flower. I liked it so much that I read and re-read it more than once, but I could not get that faintest touch of sympathy or tenderness or love, so I could not see why Mollie had written that way.
