I have a lot of problems. Many of them are real and in some cases very very deep. I don't feel much sense of control over those. The fact of the matter is that I have spent many years trying to control it.

So as I write this I am watching an evil, vicious criminal who is using an extremely high level of technology to achieve his goal and the consequence of which is that a lot of innocent people die. Those in the government which controls society are responsible for that in this case so they aren't being held accountable to any actual responsibility. It's a pretty serious.
