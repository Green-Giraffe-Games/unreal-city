As a child I was obsessed with crabs. I started throwing them at little people when they tried to run away from me. But as I grew older, my crab eating had become more obsessive in nature, often resulting in the most horrific experiences.

I have eaten crabs in my sleep, sometimes with little success. In one horrific encounter, I swallowed ten crabs in my sleep.

My dreams have become increasingly surreal. I am aware of a vast expanse of time and spaces I have never before encountered, an army of strange creatures with faces of the dead, a universe filled with vast numbers of strange things that make me feel like icky green cheese. I have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to move to the ocean.
