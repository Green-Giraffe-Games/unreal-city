We were taught that children's emotions are the only currency in this world, and that puppets offer joy, light, and hope to the lonely little ones. We watched in horror as one puppeteer became disorientated, and another became ill with a very bad bite inflicted through the air. Then we learned that puppets were to be handled with care. We were taught not to let them run at full power! As soon as a puppet's energy dwindled, he or she must be suspended in a harness and, if possible, placed in a crate where it can be kept in a darkened space.
